## About the Course

This 2-Day course, designed for developers and data scientists, will ramp up the attendee very quickly on Microsoft's powerful machine learning algorithm APIs as a part of Cognitive Services and chat bot development tools as part of the Bot Framework. These tools will be called out separately as independent and innovative tools-of-the-trade, as well as a big part of the course focusing on the power of combining these tools to create intelligent chat bots (think instant messaging a picture to get an intelligent caption or annotating conversations based on key phrases).  More in the v2 Syllabus [here](https://github.com/michhar/bot-education/wiki/Syllabus-for-2-Day-Workshop) and v1 of the course Syllabus is also available [here](https://github.com/michhar/bot-education/wiki/Release-v1-Bot-Framework-Syllabus--for--2-Day-Delivery).
