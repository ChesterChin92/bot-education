## Summary of this Repository

`bot-education` is a place for training resources around Microsoft Bot Framework and Cognitive Services bot-related topics.  This includes samples, labs, guides and documentation.

For additional resources see the [Additional Resources](ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES.md) section.

##  Quick Start

To begin, satisfy some pre-reqs and go through an example using the .NET Bot Builder SDK.  This introductory lab is located in this repository [here](labs/Lab_Getting_Started.md).

You'll need an IDE or good code editor (Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio Code are recommended - both are free) and the Bot Emulator, along with other development tools and subscriptions listed in the labs.

##  What can be found in `bot-education`

**Samples**
* Sample bots in Visual Studio solution formats (C#)
* Sample bots for Node.js SDK - COMING SOON
* Sample Cognitive Services API code snippets (as Jupyter notebooks mainly) found [here](/CognitiveServices/Samples)
* Sample Azure Machine Learning solutions (e.g. anomaly detection) found [here](/AzureMachineLearning/Samples)

**Labs**
* [Getting Started in the .NET SDK](labs/Lab_Getting_Started.md)
* More labs [here](/labs)
* Node.js SDK labs - COMING SOON

**Guides/Slide Decks**
* Under [Decks](/Decks) (updated often)

##  Overall learning objectives

* Learn about the different types of bots (they aren't always smart)
* Learn about the components of a bot in the context of the Microsoft Bot Framework (BF)
* Gain pratical knowledge of how to integrate Cognitive Services "smarts" into a bot
* Gain understanding around what makes for an excellent user experience
* Gain hands-on knowledge of how to quickly implement, publish, register and consume a bot with the BF
* Understand the development of bots on a deeper level by plunging into the SDKs
* Become proficient at integrating the right kind of "smarts" for the right kind of bot and use case
